# IOTA

**I**ncentivized **O**rchestrated **T**raining **A**rchitecture (IOTA) is a framework for pretraining large language models across a network of heterogeneous, unreliable, permissionless and token incentivized machines. IOTA employs a data- and pipeline-parallel architecture to accelerate training and reduce hardware requirements for participants.

**Overview**:
- Orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and streams activations between them.
- All network communication is mediated via the orchestrator, and a shared S3 bucket is used to store activations and layer weights.
- Miners compete to process as many activations as possible in the training stage.
- Miners periodically upload their local weights and merge their activations using a variant of Butterfly All-Reduce.
- Validators spot-check miners to ensure that work was performed as required.

Current run: 
15B parameter model, 5 layers

### Install
1. First install uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. Install packages using `uv sync`
3. then activate the environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`

### Miner Documentation
Running the miner is as easy as `python launch_miner.py`. For more information, reference [the official miner docs](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-9-pre-training/subnet-9-iota-mining-setup-guide)

You can also run many miners on the same machine by running `python launch_miner.py --num_miners NUMBER_OF_MINERS`

### Validation Documentation
Running the validator `python launch_validator.py`. For more information, reference [the official validator docs](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-9-pre-training/subnet-9-validating)
